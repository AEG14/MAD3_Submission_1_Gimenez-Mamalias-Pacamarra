### Task 1: Setting up Routing with GoRouter
**Assigned To:** Aithan Eulysse Gimenez and Anthony Pacamarra
**Description:** Followed the implementation demonstrated by Sir Daniel using GoRouter for setting up routing within the application.

### Task 2: Must be Able to Log In with the Predefined Account
**Assigned To:** Harley Mamalias  
**Description:** Created an aesthetically pleasing login screen with input validation, ensuring user input is validated before proceeding.

### Task 3: Aesthetically Pleasing Login Form with Validation
**Assigned To:** Harley Mamalias  
**Description:** Used `app_styles.dart` for defining constant styles, ensuring consistent aesthetics throughout the application. This aligns with the aesthetic choices allowed in the project.

### Task 4: Persisting Sessions Using SharedPreferences
**Assigned To:** Aithan Eulysse Gimenez  
**Description:** Implemented session persistence using SharedPreferences, ensuring that user sessions persist between app restarts. This fulfills the requirement for session persistence using a caching dependency since it sets `isLoggedIn` to true to the session.

### Task 5: Clearing Sessions After Logout
**Assigned To:** Aithan Eulysse Gimenez  
**Description:** Ensured sessions are cleared after logout using SharedPreferences by removing `isLoggedIn`.

### Task 6: User Must Be Able to Log In or Log Out
**Assigned To:** Anthony Pacamarra  
**Description:** Added functionality for users to log out from the application. This meets the requirement for users to be able to log in or log out.

### Task 7: Router Must React to Changes in Authentication State
**Assigned To:** Aithan Eulysse Gimenez and Anthony Pacamarra  
**Description:** Implemented the `handleRedirect` function within GoRouter to dynamically redirect based on authentication state changes. This approach followed the same implementation demonstrated by Sir Daniel, wherein the router reacts effectively to changes in authentication state.

### Other Contributions
**Assigned To:** Anthony Pacamarra
**Description:** Added UI implementation in home and profile screens.
